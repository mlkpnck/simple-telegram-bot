# Introducting
 This is a simple telegram bot based on Aiogram and Aiosqlite
 # Features
Initially, the bot was conceived as an account registrar through a dialog. The bot also has a TON payment system for account registration. But I decided to make a regular bot so that I could ask him how he was doing.
# Requeriments
* Python 3.10
* installed modules from requeriments.txt
* config file in the root directory ".env" with varieble TOKEN (telegram bot token)
